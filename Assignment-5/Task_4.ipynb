        "### 2. Analysis of Bias\n",
        "\n",
        "The AI-generated code contains significant **proxy bias**. While it doesn't explicitly use protected attributes like gender or race, it uses features that are strongly correlated with them:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Socioeconomic Bias:** The most glaring issue is the hardcoded list `top_tier_universities`. This creates a strong bias against candidates from less affluent backgrounds who may not have had the opportunity or financial means to attend these specific institutions, even if their skills are equivalent.\n",
        "* **Educational Bias:** The heavy weighting on `PhD` and `Masters` degrees can penalize highly skilled, self-taught candidates or those who gained equivalent experience through bootcamps or on-the-job training.\n",
        "* **Compounding Bias:** These factors (access to \"top-tier\" schools and advanced degrees) have historically been less accessible to women and underrepresented minorities. By rewarding these proxies, the system may **unintentionally perpetuate existing inequalities** and filter out diverse, qualified candidates.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Mitigation Ideas\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Remove Proxy Features:** The `university` feature should be removed entirely from the scoring logic.\n",
        "2.  **Focus on Skills, Not Credentials:** Instead of just `education_level`, the system could score based on **demonstrable skills** (e.g., `portfolio_project_score` or `technical_assessment_score`).\n",
        "3.  **Bias Auditing:** Before deployment, this model should be tested against a dataset to check for **disparate impact**—to see if it scores one group (e.g., by gender or ethnicity) significantly lower than another on average.\n",
